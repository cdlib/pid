Name:     PID Service prototype a.k.a. Shortcake
Authors:  scollett, briley
Date:     7/11/13

This is a prototype of a revised version of the PURL Server. It implements a core subset of the PURL spec, basically it's a tiny URL service with versioning. It is written in the ruby language and runs on the Sinatra platform (http://www.sinatrarb.com/). It uses SQLite as its primary database and Redis as the cached data store for PID redirects.

Dependencies
It is recommended that you install the following gems to get the application running on
your system with bundler: bundler install

Redis and SQLite must be installed.

From the root project dir:
  To start redis:
    rake redis:start
    
  To stop redis:
    rake redis:stop
    
  To run the application (without legacy data):
    thin -R config.ru start
    
  To run the application (with a subset of the legacy purl service's data):
    thin -R config.ru -e 'seeded' start
    
  To run the tests:
    rake test

Notes:
  Make sure that all tests pass before you commit any changes to the git repo!
