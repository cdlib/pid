Name:     PID Service prototype a.k.a. Shortcake
Authors:  scollett, briley
Date:     7/9/13


This is a prototype of a revised version of the PURL Service. It is written in the ruby 
language and runs on the Sinatra platform (http://www.sinatrarb.com/). It uses SQLite as 
its primary database and Redis as the cached data store for PID redirects.

It is recommended that you install the following gems to get the application running on
your system:
    gem install sinatra
    gem install thin
    gem install redis
    gem install fake-redis
    gem install datamapper
    
    
    
From the root project dir:
  To start redis:
    rake redis:start
    
  To stop redis:
    rake redis:stop
    
  To run the application (without legacy data):
    thin -R config.ru start
    
  To run the application (with a subset of the legacy purl service's data):
    thin -R config.ru -e 'seeded' start
    
  To run the tests:
    rake test
  


Notes:
  Make sure that all tests pass before you commit any changes to the git repo!
  
  To run the application with the seed data from the legacy purl service you will need
  to retrieve the source from:
    ssh://bibutil-dev-vm.cdlib.org/apps/bibutil/repos/pid_legacy_db.git
